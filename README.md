# Nonce Calculator Web App

A web-based Nonce Calculator that simulates how nonces are used in cryptography and blockchain. Generate random or custom strings, search for target hash patterns, and view attempts, time, and hash rate. Built with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Licensed under MIT.

## ðŸ“– What is a Nonce?

A nonce (number used once) is a random or pseudo-random number that helps secure data. In blockchain mining, miners search for a nonce that, combined with data, produces a hash matching certain criteria.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. Input a random or custom string.
2. The app generates an initial SHA-1 hash.
3. It adds nonce values and re-hashes until the target pattern is found.
4. Results include attempts, time, and hash rate.
